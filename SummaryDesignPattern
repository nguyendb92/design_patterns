# Builder

- Some objects are simple and can be created in a single initializer call
- Other object require a lot of ceremony to create
- Having an object with 10 initializer arguments is not productive
- Instead, opt for piecewise construction
- Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step
  
## Define
    > When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly.

## Summary

    > - A builder is a separate component for building an object
    > - Can either give builder an initializer or return it via a static function
    > - To make builder fluent, return self
    > - Different facets of an object can be built with different builders working in tan dem via a base class
