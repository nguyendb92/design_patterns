# Solid principle

## Single Reponsibility Principle

    - A class should only have one reason to change
    - Separation of concerns -different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems

## Open-Closed Principle
    
    - Class should be open for extension but closed for modification

## Liskov Substition Principle

    - You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype

# Interface Segregation Principle

    - Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces
    - YAGNI - You Ain't Going to Need It
  
# Dependency Inversion Principle

    - High level module should not depend upon low level ones, use abstractions
